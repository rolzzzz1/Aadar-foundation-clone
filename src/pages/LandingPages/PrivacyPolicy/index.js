              A privacy policy states how you will respect the privacy of your website users. It
              says what information you will gather, how you will use it and how you will keep it
              secure. A privacy policy is a legal document that discloses some or all of the ways a
              party gathers, uses, discloses and manages a customerâ€™s data. The exact contents of a
              privacy policy will depend upon the applicable law and may need to address the
              requirements of multiple countries or jurisdictions. While there is no universal
              guidance for the content of specific privacy policies, a number of organization
              provide example forms.

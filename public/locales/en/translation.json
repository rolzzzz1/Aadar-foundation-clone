Every day, we rescue individuals—elderly, injured, and mentally or physically ill—left to suffer in public spaces without food, medical care, or dignity. Many are on the brink of a lonely, painful death. At Aadar Foundation, we provide shelter, medical aid, nourishment, and, most importantly, love—because every life deserves care and respect. Together, we can give them a second chance.",

With this vision, <1>Mr. Vikas Goswami</1> began his journey of service on <1>July 1, 2015</1>, reaching out to the most vulnerable—those who were wounded, sick, abandoned, or disabled—struggling to survive on the streets. He and his team sought out these individuals at railway stations, bus stands, outside temples, and other places across the city, providing them with first aid and care.",

At <1>Swarg Sadan</1>, we provide them with <1>shelter, nutritious food, medical care, clean clothing, counseling, recreational activities, and a warm, family-like environment.</1>",

So far, we have welcomed <1>230 Prabhu Jans (beloved souls) into our ashram</1>, successfully <1>rehabilitating 98 individuals</1> with their families across <1>Nepal and 13 states in India</1>. Currently, <1>105 Prabhu Jans</1> are receiving full-time care at our facility.",
